			<b>RYLA</b> is Rotary's youth leadership training program.  Though there are many variations for RYLA programs, our district's
			RYLA works with students the June after their sophomore year in high school.  RYLA programs in other areas are designed for
			college students or young adults just beginning their professional careers.  RYLA emphasizes leadership, citizenship, personal
			growth and service. <br/><br/>

			Here in District 7780 we believe that RYLA will assist young people to realize their potential and to adapt to experiences
			within their life and their communities. RYLA enables participants to join other young people from across our District.
			Students come together to exchange ideas, plans and opinions with other talented and energetic people like yourself in a
			supportive atmosphere, free from pressure and distraction. <br/><br/>

			In late June of each year, clubs throughout District 7780 send 120 high school sophomores to the Rotary Youth Leadership
			awards conference held at Camp Hinds in Raymond, Maine.  After registration, early Sunday morning, participants will be
			assigned to a Leadership Exploration Group (LEG) with 11 others where they will spend 4 days together exploring leadership
			concepts through a series of practical situations.  These include team building activities, group problem solving, confidence
			building and solo events. <br/><br/>

			Each LEG is guided through the conference by a team of experienced facilitators who have been selected by the District Chair
			because of their demonstrated leadership ability, commitment to the development of youth leaders, and experience with the
			RYLA program.

		<h3><b>Theme:</b></h3>
		<p>Every year the newly elected Rotary International President chooses a theme for Rotarians during his/her
			presidency. Last year's theme was <i>Be a gift to the world</i>. This year's theme is <i>Making a Difference</i>, chosen by
			current president Ian Riseley. The theme is meant to serve as general ethical and moral guideline for all Rotarians across
			the globe.
		</p><br></br>
		<h3><b>The Four-Way Test:</b></h3>
		<h3>Is it the truth?</h3>
		<h3>Is it fair to all concerned?</h3>
		<h3>Will it build goodwill and better friendships?</h3>
		<h3>Will it be beneficial to all concerned?</h3>
		<br></br>
		<p>
			The four way test is how we at RYLA and Rotary gauge our actions and words towards others and towards our community. Humans can
			be impulsive, so it is important to have a guideline that a leader may fall back on when it comes time to make important decisions.
			The four way test is the best way to examine yourself and your actions; if any one of these themes appears to have been violated
			in any dilemma, you may need to reassess the situation before moving on.

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			Q: <b>When is RYLA 2017?</b><br/>
			A: Sunday June 25—Wednesday June 28 2017.<br/><br/>
			Q: <b>What time should I arrive?</b><br/>
			A: All participants are expected to arrive at 8:30 A.M. on Sunday, June 25th, 2017.<br/><br/>
			Q: <b>I have other plans on Sunday morning, May I arrive late?</b><br/>
			A: Unfortunately, the answer is no. In the past we have alloswed participants to arrive late, they never really seem to
			catch up. RYLA is a fast paced conference. It’s also not faisr to the rest of your group who will depend on you.<br/><br/>
			Q: <b>What time is RYLA over?</b><br/>
			A: Closing ceremony for RYLA is Wednesday June 28th at 5:15 PM. Parents are invited to attend and encouraged to
			arrive at 5:00 or slightly before to have time to walk to the waterfront. The closing ceremony will be followed by a Barbecue
			at 5:45. Parents my attend the barbecue by purchasing a ticket for $12.00 or $20.00 for two at registration on
			the first day of camp. There is no charge for RYLA participants. Participants are released to parents after the closing
			ceremony so plan on 6:00 at the earliest.<br/><br/>

			Q: <b>What should I bring?</b><br/>
			A:
			<ul>
				<li>Consult the Equipment list for personal belongings and necessities.</li>
				<li>Parents who plan on attending Wednesday Night BBQ should bring cash on registration day for tickets.</li>
				<li>Students need the following for registration</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Medical Form - (Either BSA form by itself or accompanied by a doctor’s form). You should have already submitted
						this form by June 1st, but if you have not, bring it with you. (exception process)
					</li>

					<li>Any medications required during the week. <b>Do not pack medication in your luggage.</b></li>
					<li>Any updated information that has changed since your application. Students will not be permitted to travel with anybody
						other than a parent or guardian unless their names are on the registration forms that were sent to RYLA.
					</li>
					<li>Photo Release Form</li>
				</ol>
			</ul><br/><br/>

			Q: <b>How should I dress at the conference?</b><br/>
			A: This equipment list is designed to help you prepare for 4 days and 3 nights. Prepare for rain, as well as heat and/or
			cool evenings—possibly even cold. RYLA is an <b>OUTDOOR</b> program and will continue regardless of weather. It is best
			to dress in layers so you can peel off and add as needed. Having too many clothes is much better than not having
			enough. Students should dress appropriately for a coed camping environment. A good rule of thumb is: if your school
			wouldn’t permit you to wear it to Phys Ed class, don’t wear it to RYLA.<br/> <br/>

			Q: <b>Is there a telephone at the conference site?</b><br/>
			A: Yes, there is a phone available to participants to contact their parents/guardians only. <b>DO NOT BRING CELL
			PHONES.</b> They will not be protected from the elements and you will not be permitted to use them at camp.<br/><br/>

			Q: <b>One of my friends is going, can we share a tent / be in the same group?</b><br/>
			A: <b>No</b>, the LEG’s are set up so that there will be no two people from the same school together. LEGs and camp sites
			are arranged in random order. This gives everyone a chance to start fresh and at the same level.<br/> <br/>

			Q: <b>Can I bring my cell phone/radio/tablet/lap top/hairdryer/curling iron?</b><br/>
			A: <b>No.</b> RYLA is intentionally built to be an outdoor, electronic free camp. Electricity is limited to the dining hall, camp
			offices, and bathroom facilities. There will be no use for electronic devices at camp. There will also be no protection
			from theft or weather damage so please do not bring anything electronic with you. <br/><br/>

			Q: <b>Do I need money?</b><br/>
			A: No Rotary District 7780 and your local Rotary Clubs have taken care of all expenses for your week at camp by
			providing you with a scholarship. The RYLA staff highly encourages you to formally thank the Rotary Club that provided
			the scholarship for you to attend, upon your return from camp. Many clubs invite you back sometime in the fall to speak
			at one of their meetings.<br/><br/>

			Q: <b>How do I arrange transportation?</b><br/>
			A: Participants are responsible for their own travel arrangements. Students are NOT allowed to drive themselves or
			their friends to RYLA. You may contact your sponsoring Rotary Club to assist you with transportation.<br/><br/>

			Q: <b>What is Rotary?</b><br/>
			A: Rotary is one of the largest international service organization in the world with more than 28,000 clubs in 160 counties.
			District 7780 consists of 40 clubs in Maine and New Hampshire. Rotarians are dedicated to humanitarian service,
			high ethical standards in business and their professions and the promotion of world understanding and peace.<br/><br/>

			Q: <b>Why RYLA (Rotary Youth Leadership Awards)?</b><br/>
			A: Strong leaders are made, not born. Leadership skills and principles are learned, not inherited. Rotary clubs around
			the world are dedicated to helping young people develop their skills to the fullest. We believe that RYLA will assist
			young people to realize their potential and to adapt to experiences within their life and their communities. RYLA enables
			participants to join other young people from across our District. RYLA participants come together to exchange ideas,
			plans and opinions with other talented and energetic people like yourself in a supportive atmosphere, free from pressure
			and distractions.<br/>
